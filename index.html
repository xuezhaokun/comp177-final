          <h3>Yearly Energy Consumption from 2010 to 2014</h3>
           The main energy use in US falls in this eight categories. Each year, there is no significant change in the distribution among those energy source.
        </div>

        <div>
          The total energy consumption during 2010 and 2014 also does not have significant change, but still there is a decrease from 2010 to 2012 and then increased back from 2012 to 2014. As shown, the main energy consumption relays on fossil fuel, coal,  natural gas and electricity.

          <h3>Trend of All Kinds of Energies Consumption</h3>
          From 2010 to 2014, There is not dramatic consumption change in any specific energy. The consumption of coal continuously decreased during these years. And there is a slightly increase for the consumption of natural gas. Let’s take a closer look for each kind of energies.
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Trend of Primary Energy Consumption</h4>
            “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_energy">Primary energy (PE)</a> is an energy form found in nature that has not been subjected to any human engineered conversion or transformation process.” Based on our data, we divided primary energy into two categories: nonrenewable and renewable energy.
        </div>

        <div>
          <h5>Trend of Non-Renewable Energy Consumption</h5>
          From 2010 to 2014, the usage for coal has decreased and there are not much change for the others
        </div> 
        
        <div>
          <h5>Trend of Renewable Energy Consumption</h5>
          The consumption for <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=biomass_home">biomass</a> energy continuously increased during the period. What surprised us is that the consumption for biomass is almost twice as the consumption for hydro power. Biomass has a large variety of easy-access sources which make it such a popular renewable energy.
        </div> 
        
        <div>
          <h4>Trend of Secondary Energy Consumption</h4>
          "<a href="https://userwikis.fu-berlin.de/display/energywiki/secondary+energy">Secondary energy</a> refers to the more convenient forms of energy which are transformed from other, primary, energy sources through energy conversion processes." Based on our data,  the consumption for electricity is relatively stable during these years, but the consumption for Liquefied petroleum gas has slightly increased.

          According to our data, from 2010 to 2014, more than 50% energy consumption is from West South Central, East North Central and South Atlantic areas.

          <h3>Consumption vs Production in Different State 2010 - 2014</h3>
          <h4> 2010 </h4>
          Most of the states(40/51) have a higher consumption than production. There are several states have much higher production than consumption, that provides most of the energy production. Differently, Taxes have a very high and highest production and consumption.  
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4> 2011 </h4>
          There are (38/51) states that have a higher consumption than production. Noticeable, Taxes produces more energy than consumption since this year. The others remain similar.
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4> 2012 </h4>
          Remain similar with last year. Although the total consumption among the country is reducing, the production in some states increases.

        <div>
          <h4> 2013 </h4>
          The total consumption increases, but the production increase is more significant.

          <p>The distribution for consumption among the 8 energy source remain similar during the years. An average of 50% of the consumption is fossil fuel. Followed with natural gas and coal.
          </p>

          <p>The usage of renewable energy (Hydro, Geothermal and Biomass) varies significantly among the states.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        During the year of 2010 to 2014, the data shows a relatively stable total amount of energy consumption in US with a minor decrease and increment back. The usage of renewable energy has a minor increase, but still the main energy source relies on traditional non-renewable energy, such as fossil fuel, coal and natural gas. The increment amount is almost not noticeable compared with the huge amount of usage for non-renewable energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        From 2010 to 2014, more than 50% energy consumption was from West South Central, East North Central and South Atlantic which areas have high population density or highly depend on their industry production.California and Texas have the highest consumption during these years. And Florida, Louisiana and New York also have relatively high demand for energies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The energy consumption differs largely among different states, depends on their location and industry type structure. This also limits the usages of the type of energy source. However, the change of most of the states during the monitored years is not obvious. Still there are  some states transformed from an energy consumer to a producer during the years. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is not obvious relationship among energy consumption change rate, population growth rate and GDP change rate. As we expected, the increase of GDP and population may highly increase the need for energy; however, this assumption is not true based on our data. We think that maybe the technology has improved the efficiency of energy usage a lot during this time period and GDP is no longer heavily depend on traditional industries which need a lot energy support.
